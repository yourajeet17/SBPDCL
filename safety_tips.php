                                        <h5>3. Replace or repair damaged electrical cords to keep your home safe.</h5>
                                        <p>Damaged power cords are a serious residential electrical safety risk, and
                                            they are capable of causing both fires and electrocution. All power and
                                            extension cords should be checked regularly for signs of fraying and
                                            cracking, and they should then be repaired or replaced as needed. Power
                                            cords should not be stapled into place or run under rugs and furniture.
                                            Cords under rugs pose a tripping hazard and can overheat, while furniture
                                            can crush cord insulation and damage wires.</p>
                                        <p>The use of extension cords on a regular basis may mean that you don’t have
                                            enough outlets to fit your needs. Have a qualified electrician who
                                            understands electrical safety rules install additional outlets in rooms
                                            where you often use extension cords. When purchasing a power cord, consider
                                            the electrical load it will carry. A cord with a load of 16 AWG can handle
                                            up to 1,375 watts. For heavier loads, use a 14 or 12 AWG cord.</p>
                                        <p><em><strong>Pro tip: </strong>AWG stands for “American wire gauge.” The lower
                                                the number, the thicker the cord!</em><br>
                                            <br>
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>4. Keep your used and unused cords tidy and secure to prevent damage.</h5>
                                        <p>Electrical safety tips don’t just apply to power cords when they’re in
                                            use—cords also need to be stored safely to prevent damage. Keep stored cords
                                            away from children and pets (who may chew on or play with the cords). Try to
                                            avoid wrapping cords tightly around objects; this can stretch the cord or
                                            cause overheating. Never rest a cord on a hot surface in order to prevent
                                            damage to the cord’s insulation and wires.<br>

                                        <p>Water and electricity don’t mix well. To follow electrical safety rules, keep
                                            electrical equipment dry and away from water prevents damage to appliances
                                            and can protect against personal injury and electrocution. When working with
                                            electrical appliances, it’s important to have dry hands. Keeping electrical
                                            equipment away from plant pots, aquariums, sinks, showers and bathtubs
                                            lowers the risk of water and electricity coming into contact.<br>
